Note that 33%, the lowest end of the scale, indicates a wild guess among the three buttons, without any basis for prefering one answer option over the other. As the task is not trivial, low and intermediate confidence levels, such as 38%, 55%, and 81%, are expected in many cases. </p><p>Note that the middle of the scale is not allowed. You should decide whether your answer is more likely to be correct or closer to being a guess.</p><p>Please spread your confidence ratings across the entire range from 33% to 100%! Now, try sliding the arrow along all the scale before indicating your level of confidence.</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> Rating your confidence reliably, while using a large variety of confidence levels, is an integral part of performing the task adequately.</p></font></div><div align=""center""><p>How confident are you?</p></div><p>|A wild guess|Definitely correct</p>",#no,no,100,100,0deg,0deg,no,,

0,RA_get_ready,User,"<div align=""left""><p><b>BONUS opportunity:</b> <p>Bonus calculation is based on three measures:</p><p>1. We measure <b>solving success</b>. In our previous studies, the overall success rate was about 70% of the items. The most successful participants got to 100% success. Thus, it is possible to do. If you will have <b>more than 70% correct</b>, you will get 2 cents for each correct solution. </p><p>2. <b>Reliable confidence ratings</b>: You should assess reliably the chance that your response is correct. If your confidence  will be higher for correct responses than for wrong responses, you will get 10 pence.</p><p>3. <b>Being focused</b> on the task: Being idle for more than 30 seconds is not allowed, even if you think during this time. You must do some action with the application in order to get compensated. Moving the mouse is enough for this purpose. Each violation of this requirement will deduce 10 pence from your balance.</p></p><p>You may gain bonus up to 25 pence.</p></div>",,,,#no,no,,,,,no,,
